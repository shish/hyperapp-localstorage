HyperApp LocalStorage
=====================

A hyperapp `Subscriber` and `Effect` to save values to and load values
from the LocalStorage space.

Very much stolen from @zaceno's
[Hyperapp Code-Along](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqUr_NM6P_Y),
I'm just putting it in a package because I don't want to copy-paste across
all my projects.

See [demo.html](demo.html) for a self-contained, well-commented example.
